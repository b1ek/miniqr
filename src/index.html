<b># blek! QRGen</b>

Author: blek &lt;me@blek.codes&gt;
License: GPLv3-only (see 3)
Made with Rust and <3
Source code: https://git.blek.codes/blek/qrgen

<span class='hr'>---</span>

This is a simple microservice that generates QR codes for you via HTTP API.
It has been originally developed for blek!File ( https://file.blek.codes ),
which source code is at https://git.blek.codes/blek/bfile .

<b>## 1. HTTP API Reference</b>

GET /{ QR Code text }

Returns a QR code image with the desired text. It may be confusing that the
returned image is  very small,  but it is a  simple measure to decrease the
bandwith usage on mobile devices.

You can scale that image up with CSS, just like this:

```css

.qrcode-image {
    width: 400px;
    image-rendering: pixelated; /* This line "unblurs" the qr code */

    padding: 60px;
    background: white;
}

```

<b>## 2. Customizing the generated QR</b>

Unfourtunately, at the time I had no need to implement these features. PR's
are welcome as well as suggestions to the features.

However, the default settings for a QR are as follows:

    Correction Level =  M
    Image Type =        Grayscale PNG
    PNG Compression =   None
